# FM Radio Alarm Clock with RGB Sunrise Simulation 

This Arduino-based project combines an FM radio module, RGB LED lighting, and an alarm clock system to create a soothing sunrise wake-up experience.

1) Components Used

-> Arduino Uno/Nano
-> TEA5767 FM Radio Module
-> DS3231 Real-Time Clock (RTC)
-> RGB LED bulb
-> Push Buttons (for tuning)
-> LM386 Audio Amplifier
-> OLED Display 
-> Speaker or Headphones

2) Key Features

-> Sunrise Effect: RGB LEDs gradually brighten 5 on alarm time
-> FM Radio Wake-up: Preset FM station plays at the alarm time
-> Custom Alarm Time: Set in code
-> Energy Efficient: Smooth LED brightness transition

3) Working Principle

1. RTC keeps track of time.
2. On the alarm time, RGB LEDs begin to simulate sunrise.
3. At alarm time, FM Radio turns on automatically.
4. The user wakes up with soft light and sound.

4) How to Use

1. Upload code to Arduino
2. Adjust alarm time in code
3. Connect components as per circuit
4. Power on
